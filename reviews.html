		<p>Every week I am reminded of the importance of this project. Many people don’t realize the volume of trash that they generate on a regular basis. People often focus on the obvious items like food waste and single-use plastics, but they don’t always realize that almost every item in our day to day lives is designed to be disposable eventually. </p>

		<p>This weekend, just like every weekend, I went through my regular cleaning routine. I am shocked that after 33 weeks I still have so much stuff to dispose of. While past weeks have been more focused on cleaning out a particular area, or on generic stuff like food trash; this week in particular was focused on used items that have served their purpose, particularly those that are broken. </p>

		<p>As mentioned above, my Item of the Week for this round is the spare CPU that I donated. I’ve had it sitting around in my basement for years. It was bought originally not by me but by the owner of a metal shop that I was working for, my job was to design and build a replacement backup server. The CPU was ordered for the new server, however it was ordered from Amazon in 2021 when there were massive shipping delays, and it ended up arriving over two months after it was ordered. In the interim, I managed to buy an equivalent chip from Best Buy in person. As a result, the CPU that was ordered online was no longer necessary. I suggested returning it, but the metal shop owner felt that that would be too much of a hassle, so he just gave the CPU to me. Since I already had a very similar chip in my desktop, and I wasn’t planning on building a new PC anytime soon, the CPU just sat in the box in my basement for a couple years. I finally was able to get rid of it this week by donating it to a friend who wanted it for his new PC build. </p>
		<p>The CPU is a Ryzen 3 3200G, designed and manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD). It is one of the earlier generation Ryzen chips, which are a line of CPUs started in 2017 that were designed to be competent and powerful for a substantially cheaper price than their competitors. My own desktop uses a Ryzen 3 2200G chip, which I got for less than $90 in 2018. An equivalent Intel CPU could have easily cost me over $300. The CPU that I donated was built on the Zen+ microarchitecture, with a 12nm process. It has 4 cores and 4 threads as 3.6 GHz along with a built-in graphics chip. That was part of what made it useful for the server, was that we didn’t have to buy a separate graphics card.</p>
