		<h2 id="score-review">Score Review</h2>
		
		<p>Revenge of the Sith is the final of the three Star Wars prequels, and was at the time believed to be the final entry in the saga. Composer John Williams approached the score with this mindset, creating a score meant to summarize the ideas of the prequels and lead into those of the originals. </p>
		<p>As a result of being the “final” entry, ROTS doesn’t have very many new themes. It has a short march for General Grievous, the film’s main henchman; it has an arrival theme, for landing on planets, which is only used twice. It has a big bombastic battle theme for the fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan (the concert suite is titled Battle of the Heroes on the album), which is sort of reminiscent of the similar Duel of the Fates theme from the first prequel. And lastly, it has a sad choir lamentation theme that represents the fall of the Jedi order – it’s also only used twice in the film, but both appearances are highly memorable and underscore dramatic, emotional scenes. </p>
		<p>So, what do I think of the score overall? I think it’s a wonderful score, with lots of great highlights. I love the battle music for the opening, especially cues like 1M3 Boys Into Battle, and 1M5 The Elevator Scene. They’re highly memorable, and they make a great start to the film, even if they aren’t overly thematic. </p>
		<p>I do find that the middle meanders for a little bit, for example the 6 minute long cue 2M6 Scenes and Dreams doesn’t have too much going on, and cues like 3M1 Council Meeting, while interesting, have large sections copy pasted from previous scores. Even the source cue 3M2a Palpatine’s TV Set is a bit boring, it’s just some low male choir without much melody. </p>
		<p>The score starts to turn around about halfway through the fourth reel. 4M3 Palpatine’s Seduction and 4M5 Dialogue with Mace provide some great uneasiness as we approach the turning point, which is realized in 4M6 I Am the Senate, which might be one of the best action cues Williams has ever written. It’s a pity that this part of the film was edited so heavily and that the cue got butchered in the final cut. </p>
		<p>From here on out the second half of the film is an absolute masterpiece. Almost every cue is highly memorable and does a beautiful job conveying the emotional depth of the story. Particular standouts for me emotionally include 5M3 Lament, 6M1 It Can’t Be, 6M3 Padme’s Visit, 7M1 The Immolation Scene, and 7M6 Padme’s Funeral. </p>
		<p>This half of the film also has some brilliant action music, with cues like 5M6 Moving Things Along, 5M7 Anakin’s Dark Deeds, 6M4 Heroes Collide, 6M7 The Boys Continue, and 6M9 Revenge of the Sith.
		<p>Overall, I think this score has some great highlights and is absolutely worth checking out, even if it doesn’t have that many new themes, and it does a beautiful job wrapping up the first 6 films of the Skywalker Saga.

		<p>This weekend, just like every weekend, I went through my regular cleaning routine. I am shocked that after 33 weeks I still have so much stuff to dispose of. While past weeks have been more focused on cleaning out a particular area, or on generic stuff like food trash; this week in particular was focused on used items that have served their purpose, particularly those that are broken. </p>

		<p>As mentioned above, my Item of the Week for this round is the spare CPU that I donated. I’ve had it sitting around in my basement for years. It was bought originally not by me but by the owner of a metal shop that I was working for, my job was to design and build a replacement backup server. The CPU was ordered for the new server, however it was ordered from Amazon in 2021 when there were massive shipping delays, and it ended up arriving over two months after it was ordered. In the interim, I managed to buy an equivalent chip from Best Buy in person. As a result, the CPU that was ordered online was no longer necessary. I suggested returning it, but the metal shop owner felt that that would be too much of a hassle, so he just gave the CPU to me. Since I already had a very similar chip in my desktop, and I wasn’t planning on building a new PC anytime soon, the CPU just sat in the box in my basement for a couple years. I finally was able to get rid of it this week by donating it to a friend who wanted it for his new PC build. </p>
		<p>The CPU is a Ryzen 3 3200G, designed and manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (AMD). It is one of the earlier generation Ryzen chips, which are a line of CPUs started in 2017 that were designed to be competent and powerful for a substantially cheaper price than their competitors. My own desktop uses a Ryzen 3 2200G chip, which I got for less than $90 in 2018. An equivalent Intel CPU could have easily cost me over $300. The CPU that I donated was built on the Zen+ microarchitecture, with a 12nm process. It has 4 cores and 4 threads as 3.6 GHz along with a built-in graphics chip. That was part of what made it useful for the server, was that we didn’t have to buy a separate graphics card.</p>
